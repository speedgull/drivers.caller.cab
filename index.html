            <p>CallerCab is different. We're proud to be a cooperative business. One that is owned and managed by the workers themselves.</p>
            <p>There are no shareholders or investors taking a slice of our earnings.</p>
            <p>Everyone pays an equal share of the costs and gets equal access to the work. What could be fairer than that?</p>

          <h3>You're in control</h3>
          <p>CallerCab supplements your existing commitments. Squeeze extra jobs in-between working the rank, account customers, school-runs or phone bookings.</p>
          <p>You can log into the system whenever you want and are free to accept or reject any jobs that are offered to you via the app.</p>
          <p>Unlimited access. The app is available to use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
          <p>We charge hackney tariffs across our entire fleet, with drivers taking all payments themselves. No discounted fares, no commission and no hidden fees.</p>
          <p>Cash or card? Customers specify their payment method when making a booking. This allows us to filter jobs based on your preferences. If you operate a cash-only taxi, we'll only send you cash jobs.</p>
          <p>You choose when you want to work. </p>
          <p>We'll provide you with all the statistics you need to help you decide the most profitable times for your car to be on the road.</p>
          <p>What's more, you're not tied into lengthy contracts. You're free to leave and join the cooperative as often as you please.</p>

          <h3>About us</h3>
          <p>CallerCab is an online booking agency, created to unite drivers who have had enough of being exploited by traditional taxi and private hire companies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Keep your existing customers</h3>
          <p>You've worked hard to build your business and you've probably got plenty of loyal customers that you'd like to retain.</p>
          <p>Because CallerCab operates an online service that supplements your existing commitments, you're free to continue accepting direct bookings or work from the taxi ranks.</p>
          <p>We can also help you manage your business account customers;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dedicated booking portal</li>
            <li>Specify which vehicles can be assigned account jobs</li>
            <li>Custom tariffs</li>
            <li>Integrated accounting and invoicing</li>

        <section>
          <h3>Jobs assigned fairly</h3>
          <p>Everyone is equal at CallerCab. Our app tracks vehicle locations using GPS and matches incoming jobs to the nearest available car. If two or more cars are a similar distance away then it is offered to whoever has waited longest.</p>
          <p>Lost runs needn't mean lost earnings. If a customer doesn't show up you'll automatically get first refusal on the next available booking.</p>
          <p>Long distance jobs are offered on a rotational basis with each car taking its turn.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Low fees and no commission</h3>
          <p>We don't have an expensive office staffed by overpaid managers - our business is conducted entirely online and democratically managed by our members.</p>
          <p>There are no hidden fees and we don't charge commission. You get to keep 100% of the fare, and we charge hackney carriage tariffs across our entire fleet. No discounts, no cheap fares, and no greedy businessmen benefiting from your hard work!</p>
          <p>Each vehicle owner pays an equal share of the costs and in return receives an equal share of the work. What could be fairer than that?</p>
