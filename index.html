          <p>CallerCab is different. We're proud to be a cooperative business. One that is owned and managed by the workers themselves.</p>
          <p>Everyone pays an equal share of the costs and gets equal access to the work. What could be fairer than that?</p>

          <h3>You're in control</h3>
          <p>CallerCab fits around your existing commitments. You can log into the system whenever you want and are free to accept or reject any jobs that are offered to you via the app.</p>
          <p>You choose when you want to work. </p>
          <p>We'll provide you with all the statistics you need to help you decide the most profitable times for your car to be on the road.</p>
          <p>What's more, you're not tied into lengthy contracts. You're free to leave and join the cooperative as often as you please.</p>

          <h3>About us</h3>
          <p>CallerCab is an online booking agency, created to unite drivers who have had enough of being exploited by traditional taxi and private hire companies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Keep your existing customers</h3>
          <p>You've worked hard to build your business and you've probably got plenty of loyal customers that you'd like to retain.</p>
          <p>Because CallerCab operates an online service that supplements your existing commitments, you're free to continue accepting direct bookings or work from the taxi ranks.</p>
          <p>We can also help you manage your business account customers;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dedicated booking portal</li>
            <li>Specify which vehicles can be assigned account jobs</li>
            <li>Custom tariffs</li>
            <li>Integrated accounting and invoicing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Want to offer a more reliable and efficient service? We will be more than happy to help you integrate your customers into our booking system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Jobs assigned fairly</h3>
          <p>Everyone is equal at CallerCab. Our app tracks vehicle locations using GPS and matches incoming jobs to the nearest available car. If two or more cars are a similar distance away then it is offered to whoever has waited longest.</p>
          <p>Lost runs needn't mean lost earnings. If a customer doesn't show up you'll automatically get first refusal on the next available booking.</p>
          <p>Long distance jobs are offered on a rotational basis with each car taking its turn.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Low fees and no commission</h3>
          <p>We don't have an expensive office staffed by overpaid managers - our business is conducted entirely online and democratically managed by our members.</p>
          <p>There are no hidden fees and we don't charge commission. You get to keep 100% of the fare, and we charge hackney carriage tariffs across our entire fleet. No discounts, no cheap fares, and no greedy businessmen benefiting from your hard work!</p>
          <p>Each vehicle owner pays an equal share of the costs and in return receives an equal share of the work. What could be fairer than that?</p>
